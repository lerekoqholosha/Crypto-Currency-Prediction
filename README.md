<h1> Crypto Currency Price Predictor</h1>

<center><a href="http://45.79.23.203/">Use this link to register and see how it works</a>.</center>
<p>This is my first Machine Learning Web Application. My purpose was learning Flask and merge it with Machine Learning. When you hit on the Go button it calls Yahoo Finance and takes crypto prices. Next prepare them for modelling, feed them to the net and train the model. Finally it  will predict crypto prices for 5-days and plot it in a graph. The backend is supported by a pre-designed MLP Neural Network-Tensorflow (3- hiddden levels). For more information about the structure, follow my repositories  <a href="https://github.com/akmuthun/Time-Series-Neural-Network-Grid-Search">Time-Series-Neural-Network-Grid-Search </a> and <a href="https://github.com/akmuthun/stock_market_predictions_neural_net">stock_market_predictions_neural_net. </a> </p> 
<p> The performance can be optimized by changing the network structure or by changing to LSTM or RNN network as discussed in the repositories above. </p>
